# Melegraf

 Melegraf is an agent for collecting, processing, aggregating, and writing metrics. It was inspired by [telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf), which is based on a plugin system to enable developers to easily add support for additional metric collection. However, telegraf has an stationary procedure to handle metrics.

 To make metric handling procedure more flexible, melegraf allows users to configure a number of processors that work on metrics and a number of conveyors that transfer metrics between processors. Users can organize processors and conveyors in whatever way they want. This design was inspired by a computer game [Dyson Sphere Program](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366540/Dyson_Sphere_Program/), which allows players to build a factory to produce items. The factory is composed of a number of buildings, and each building has a number of input and output ports. Players can organize buildings in whatever way they want to produce items.
